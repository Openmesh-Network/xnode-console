## Service definitions
The services all have enable=true appended so no need to configure that option. Service-definitions is ultimately a stand-in with preset templates geared towards Xnode Units, the intention is to replace it with an isomorphic git-based system later to enable fully featured configuration. 

When contributing to these definitions, aim to configure the most sensible and fully-featured defaults.
