# Xnode Studio

## Installation and dev environment
</br>

Using npm to install the dependecies (at the moment there is depeencies conflicts that will need to be resolved, so use --force)
```shell
npm install --force
```
</br>
</br>
When in development mode, make sure to comment out the following line in next.config.js: `assetPrefix: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ASSET_PREFIX,`
As Xnode studio uses Vercel Routing to instantiate its paths, the production environment needs to have this assetPrefix set to work successfully. However, it is not needed during development (localhost). For more information, visit: https://github.com/Openmesh-Network/urlPathL3A
